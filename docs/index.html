<p> It's very hard to go wrong, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed when confronted with such a delicious menu in a very slow-moving line.
  Here's some guidance: </p>

    <tr><td>Classic Jumbo: Egg, Cheddar, Mustard Butter, Avocado</td>       <td class=ycell>This sandwich is always delicious. Try it on a chedder-garlic bagel.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bagel with Honey Rosemary Cream Cheese</td>                     <td class=ycell>This cream cheese is amazing, especially on a sesame or pretzel bagel.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>T-Rex: Almond Butter, Banana, Honey, Bacon</td>                 <td class=mcell>I would like someone else to order this and tell me how it is.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bagelsaurus coffee </td>                                        <td class=mcell>Could be a lot better. Go next door to Simon's if you have time.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bagel with beet hummus </td>                                    <td class=nocell>I've only seen one person order this, and the person at the register looked upset.</td></tr>

<p> Bagelsaurus gets <em>very</em> crowded at certain times, so set your expectations based on when you go:

<p><b>'No line' times:</b> Anytime besides 12pm on weekdays or before 9am on weekends (this is the best time, because of the weekend cheddar-garlic bagels)</p>
<p><b>'Short line' times:</b> Between 9-9:45am or after 2pm on weekends.
<p><b>'Wait in line' times:</b> Bring a friend, book, charged phone, and small snack if you are going between 9:45 - 2pm on a weekend,
  as you'll be in line for 40-60 minutes. Also bring sunscreen or an umbrella depending on the weather, since you'll be outside for the majority of your wait.</p>

<p> If you've moved to Chicago, you are going to be OK because you can go to Chicago Bagel Authority. The bagels are different,
  but still delicious.<br> <em> CBA on the left; Bagelsaurus on the right.</em> </p>
